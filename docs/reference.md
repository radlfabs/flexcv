# Reference

Welcome to the reference documentation for `flexcv`. This section provides detailed information about the classes, methods, and functions in our codebase. It's intended for those who want to understand the inner workings of our project or use its APIs.

Each module, class and function has its own section, with a description, a list of parameters and their types, and the return type. Examples of usage are provided where applicable.

This documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings in our source code using `mkdocstrings`, so it's always up-to-date with the latest version of the code.

Navigate through the sections to explore the different parts of our project.
