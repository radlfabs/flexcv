This guide will help you get started with the `flexcv` package quickly. It will show you how to install the package and how to use it to compare machine learning models on your data. At the end of this section you will have a working environment to start using `flexcv` for your own projects.

## Installation

Install the package using `pip` from the command line:
```
pip install flexcv
```
`flexcv` was tested with Python 3.10 and 3.11. 
To separate Python environments on your system, you can use the `venv` package from the standard library.

```bash
cd path/to/this/repo
python -m venv my_env_name
my_env_name/Scripts/activate
pip install flexcv
```

Now you have installed everything you need to perform flexible cross validation and machine learning on your tabular data.
